# TODO
+ [ ] (`line 5`) Get error handling for grids with a size greater than two.
+ [ ] (`line 18`) Change `__is_redundant` to get rid of redundant updates (e.g.
      an updating the same cell twice), rather than just looking at the state
      of the grid, which should be handled when defining a rule.
