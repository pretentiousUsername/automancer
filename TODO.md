# TODO
+ [ ] (`line 5`) Get error handling for grids with a size greater than two.
+ [ ] (`line 18`) Change `__is_redundant` to get rid of redundant updates (e.g.
      updating the same cell twice), rather than just looking at the state of
      the grid, which should be handled when defining a rule.
+ [ ] Find a way to get rid of redundancies while not messing up the state.
+ [ ] Generate animations.
